It's true that just following a tutorial learning. I agree that, "But if you focus and follow along code with the instructor and making the projects is also a effective way. Only after finishing the project, Try to make it by yourself. And face every Problem and error try to write the code as same a the instructor. and then apply extra feature. also try to make it in different ways. That will blow up skill. That's my Perspective
